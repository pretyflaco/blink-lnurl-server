# Blink LNURL Server

Blink LNURL Server provides LNURL-pay and Lightning Address endpoints backed by Spark invoice creation.

## What It Does

The server lets a user register a username and Spark public key. After registration, the server can:

- Serve LNURL-pay metadata for `username@domain.com`.
- Create Spark Lightning invoices for that registered user.
- Serve Lightning Address discovery at `/.well-known/lnurlp/{username}`.
- Store invoice metadata for LUD-21 verification, sender comments, zaps, and webhook delivery.

## NIP-05 (nostr verification)

`username@domain` doubles as a verified nostr handle. Binding a nostr key to a
handle requires **both** proofs, so a user can never claim a nostr key they do
not control:

- Account ownership: the standard Spark identity-key signature (same scheme
  as the other `/lnurlpay/{pubkey}` routes), or — for blink custodial
  accounts — a Blink session token validated server-side via GraphQL `me`.
- Key control: a kind-22242 (or 27235) nostr event signed by the nostr key
  carrying an `lnaddress` tag equal to the account's handle.

`GET /.well-known/nostr.json?name=N` answers with exactly the queried name
(static overlay entries like the domain root `_` first, then the registry) or
a uniform 404. Bindings are deleted in the same transaction as username
deletions and transfers, so a handle can never stay verified for a key whose
owner no longer holds the username.

Trust model: the endpoint is attestation by the domain operator, per the NIP
("identification, not verification"). Public per-name probing is inherent to
the protocol; the server never enumerates the registry.

Trust model: the user must trust the LNURL server and Spark Service Provider not to collude by sharing the preimage. The user must also trust the LNURL server to return invoices that pay the registered user.

## Development Environment

Use Nix for local dependencies. The flake provides stable Rust, protobuf, OpenSSL, Docker Compose, Bats, PostgreSQL tools, cargo-audit, and typos.

With direnv:

```shell
direnv allow
```

Without direnv, prefix commands with `nix develop -c`:

```shell
nix develop -c make build
```

## Common Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `make build` | Build all Rust targets with `Cargo.lock` enforced |
| `make check-code` | Run `cargo fmt --check` and clippy with warnings denied |
| `make test-rust` | Run Rust tests without the optional Postgres test URL |
| `make start-deps` | Start local Docker Compose dependencies |
| `make stop-deps` | Stop local Docker Compose dependencies |
| `make reset-deps` | Restart local Docker Compose dependencies |
| `make start` | Start Postgres and run the LNURL server locally |
| `make test-integration` | Run Postgres-backed Rust tests |
| `make e2e` | Run Bats end-to-end tests |
| `make release-check` | Run the full release gate: formatting, clippy, Rust tests, Postgres integration tests, mocked E2E tests, and dependency audit |
| `make audit` | Run `cargo audit` |

## Release Verification

Run the complete local release gate before claiming milestone readiness:

```shell
nix develop -c make release-check
```

`release-check` runs the standard gates in order: `make check-code`, `make test-rust`, `make test-integration`, `make test-e2e`, and `make audit`. Treat any failed, skipped, flaky, or infrastructure-blocked command as release-blocking until it is fixed or precisely documented with the command, exit status, and blocker.

## Mocked Blink E2E Posture

Blink E2E coverage is deterministic and must not call live Blink services or Blink quickstart. The local E2E stack points the server at the checked-in `blink_graphql_mock` binary through `LNURL_BLINK_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` (or the matching `blink_graphql_endpoint` configuration option) so GraphQL invoice creation and payment-status behavior are exercised against local fixtures only.

The mocked E2E setup documents environment variable names and local endpoints only; do not add private keys, service tokens, `.envrc` contents, or live Blink credentials to tests or docs.

## Build

Development build:

```shell
nix develop -c make build
```

Release build:

```shell
nix develop -c cargo build --release --locked --bin lnurl-server
```

The release binary is written to `target/release/lnurl-server`.

## Run Locally

Start the local Postgres dependency and LNURL server:

```shell
LNURL_BLINK_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://<your-local-blink>/graphql nix develop -c make start
```

The local stack uses:

- Postgres 17 from `docker-compose.yml`.
- `DEPLOYMENT_ENV=local`.
- `LNURL_DB_URL=postgres://user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/lnurl`.
- `LNURL_DOMAINS=localhost:8080,127.0.0.1:8080`.
- `LNURL_SCHEME=http`.

`DEPLOYMENT_ENV` drives provider runtime selection:

- `production` → Spark/LNURL `mainnet`, Blink production GraphQL.
- `staging` → Spark/LNURL `regtest`, Blink signet behavior with `https://api.staging.blink.sv/graphql`.
- `local` → Spark/LNURL `regtest`, Blink local behavior through the configured `LNURL_BLINK_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` override path.

Spark staging stays explicitly pinned to `regtest` for now so the later Spark `regtest -> signet` switch is a one-line startup mapping change.

Explicit overrides still win when needed: use `LNURL_SPARK_NETWORK` to override Spark/LNURL network defaults and `LNURL_BLINK_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` to override the Blink GraphQL URL. `DEPLOYMENT_ENV=local` requires `LNURL_BLINK_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` because this repo does not define one fixed local Blink service URL.

For Blink invoice callbacks during local runs, `scripts/start-local-stack.sh` defaults the webhook domain to `localhost:8080` so Blink invoices receive `http://localhost:8080/webhook/blink` callbacks. Override it with `LNURL_WEBHOOK_DOMAIN` when using a different local host or public tunnel.

`make start` also expects `LNURL_BLINK_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` to point at the Blink local or mock GraphQL endpoint for `DEPLOYMENT_ENV=local`.

Run end-to-end tests:

```shell
nix develop -c make e2e
```

## Docker

Build a static musl binary from source and copy it into an Ubuntu runtime image:

```shell
docker build -t blink-lnurl-server .
```

Run the source-built image:

```shell
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e DEPLOYMENT_ENV="production" \
  -e LNURL_ADDRESS="0.0.0.0:8080" \
  -e LNURL_AUTO_MIGRATE="true" \
  -e LNURL_DB_URL="postgres://user:password@postgres_host:5432/lnurl" \
  -e LNURL_DOMAINS="yourdomain.com" \
  -e LNURL_WEBHOOK_DOMAIN="yourdomain.com" \
  blink-lnurl-server
```

`Dockerfile.release` builds a minimal distroless runtime image from a prebuilt static `lnurl-server` binary in the Docker build context:

```shell
cp target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/lnurl-server ./lnurl-server
docker build \
  -f Dockerfile.release \
  --build-arg VERSION="v0.1.0" \
  -t blink-lnurl-server:v0.1.0 \
  .
rm ./lnurl-server
```

## Configuration

The server merges configuration in this order, with later sources overriding earlier ones:

1. Command-line argument defaults.
2. TOML config file.
3. Environment variables prefixed with `LNURL_`.

Example `lnurl.conf`:

```toml
address = "0.0.0.0:8080"
auto_migrate = true
db_url = "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/lnurl"
domains = "yourdomain.com"
log_level = "info"
max_sendable = 4000000000
min_sendable = 1000
scheme = "https"
```

Set `DEPLOYMENT_ENV` in the process environment to select `production`, `staging`, or `local`. When unset or blank, startup now defaults to `production`.

Important options:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--address` | Address the server listens on | `0.0.0.0:8080` |
| `--auto-migrate` | Automatically apply database migrations during normal startup | `false` |
| `--migrate-only` | Apply database migrations and exit without starting the server | `false` |
| `--db-url` | PostgreSQL or SQLite connection string | `""` |
| `--domains` | Comma-separated allowed domains | `localhost:8080` |
| `--log-level` | `RUST_LOG` style filter | `info` |
| `--scheme` | Scheme used in generated LNURL callback URLs | `https` |
| `--min-sendable` | Minimum payment amount in millisatoshi | `1000` |
| `--max-sendable` | Maximum payment amount in millisatoshi | `4000000000` |
| `--webhook-domain` | Domain used for provider webhook URLs. Required for Blink invoice callbacks; Blink invoice creation sends `{scheme}://{webhook-domain}/webhook/blink`. Also used when registering the Spark SSP webhook URL. | unset |
| `--ssp-auth-seed` | Hex-encoded 32-byte seed for Spark SSP authentication | random |
| `--nostr-static-names` | JSON object of statically-served NIP-05 names (`{"_":"<64-char lowercase hex>"}`), served before the dynamic registry — use for the domain root `_` and official accounts | unset |

`DEPLOYMENT_ENV` accepts `production`, `staging`, or `local` and sets the default provider wiring. When unset or blank, startup defaults to `production`. `LNURL_SPARK_NETWORK` and `LNURL_BLINK_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` are optional explicit overrides.

`LNURL_WEBHOOK_DOMAIN` is required when running the server with Blink invoice support. Blink invoice creation passes a callback URL of `{LNURL_SCHEME}://{LNURL_WEBHOOK_DOMAIN}/webhook/blink` to Blink GraphQL for both BTC and USD invoices. The Blink callback route accepts flat provider payloads at public `POST /webhook/blink`; it is separate from the Spark SSP webhook at `POST /webhook`.

For the complete list:

```shell
nix develop -c cargo run --locked --bin lnurl-server -- --help
```

## Database Backends

The server chooses the database implementation from `db_url`:

- PostgreSQL: connection strings beginning with `postgres`.
- SQLite: any other connection string, for example `lnurl.sqlite`.

When `auto_migrate` is enabled, the server applies the embedded SQL migrations on startup. Use `--migrate-only` to run the same embedded migrations without starting the server.

## API Endpoints

Authenticated routes always require Spark signatures. If `ca_cert` is configured, authenticated routes also require a bearer certificate signed by that CA.

## Installation

Install the development toolchain and dependencies with Nix, then build the Rust binaries with Cargo through the project `Makefile`:

```bash
nix develop -c make build
```

If you use `direnv`, run `direnv allow` once and then use the same `make` targets without the `nix develop -c` prefix.

## Quick Start

1. Start the local PostgreSQL dependency and LNURL server:

   ```bash
   nix develop -c make start
   ```

2. Check that the server is responding:

   ```bash
   curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/health
   ```

3. Run the deterministic end-to-end suite against the local stack:

   ```bash
   nix develop -c make e2e
   ```

## Usage Examples

Check server health:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/health
```

Expected result: HTTP `200 OK`.

Fetch LNURL-pay metadata for a registered identifier:

```bash
curl -fsS \
  --header "Host: localhost:8080" \
  http://localhost:8080/.well-known/lnurlp/alice
```

Expected result: a JSON response with `tag: "payRequest"`, `minSendable`, `maxSendable`, `metadata`, `commentAllowed`, and a `callback` such as `http://localhost:8080/lnurlp/alice/invoice`.

Request an invoice from the LNURL callback:

```bash
curl -fsS \
  --header "Host: localhost:8080" \
  'http://localhost:8080/lnurlp/alice/invoice?amount=1000&comment=hello'
```

Expected result: a JSON response containing `pr`, `verify`, and an empty `routes` array, or an LNURL error response if the identifier is not registered or the amount is out of range.
